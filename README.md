## Usage

### Crat Project
To create a project you can use either the short menu with the shortcut `ctrl + alt + m`  or the menu item `Project -> CProject -> New CProject`

After that you have to enter a project name and the project directory.

### Set Source File
To compile you have to set the source file which holds the main function. In order to set the source file you can either use the short menu with the shortcut `ctrl + alt + m` or the menu item `Project -> CProject -> Set Source File`

After that you can choose which opened file should be used.

### Alter Object Files
In order to add, alter or remove Object Fildes from the compiler command you can use the short menu with the shortcut `ctrl + alt + m` or use the menu item `Project -> CProject -> Alter Object Files`

After that you can choose between the options "Add object file" or "Add from opened files", if you have already set a object file you have the additional options "Alter object file" which allows you to allter the path to the object file and "Delete object file"
