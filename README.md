# cProjects
Sublime Text 3 plugin to manage your c/c++ Projects.

## Important
This plugin is only tested on a linux platform yet. I would by happy to know if it runs on an other platform.

## Synopsis
This plugin expands the sublime text by a simple  C and C++ Integrated Development Environment.
Features include: support for project creation, customizable compiler command, include autocomplete, easy include and libry management.
More features are planned.

## Installation
Clone the repository in to the Sublime Text Packages folder.
```bash
cd [Packages folder]
git clone https://github.com/musdasch/cProjects.git
```

## Usage

After that you have to enter a project name and the project directory.

### Set Source File
To compile you have to set the source file which holds the main function. In order to set the source file you can either use the short menu with the shortcut `ctrl + alt + m` or the menu item `Project` > `CProject` > `Set Source File`

After that you can choose which opened file should be used.

### Alter Object Files
In order to add, alter or remove Object Fildes from the compiler command you can use the short menu with the shortcut `ctrl + alt + m` or use the menu item `Project` > `CProject` > `Alter Object Files`

After that you can choose between the options `Add object file` or `Add from opened files`, if you have already set a object file you have the additional options `Alter object file` which allows you to allter the path to the object file and `Delete object file`

### Alter Includes

After that you can chosse between `Add library path`, `Alter library path` or `Delete library path`.

### Set Build Path
By default the build path is `[project path]/bin/builds` in order to change the path you can use the short menu with the shortcut `ctrl + alt + m` or the menu item `Project` > `CProject` > `Set build path` and set an new directory to build in.

### Set Single Build Path
There is also the option to separately change the build path for the single build command. To change the build path for single source files you can use either the short menu with the shortcut `ctrl + alt + m` or  the menu item `Project` > `CProject` > `Set Single Build Path`.

Default single run command: `gnome-terminal  -- bash -c "${single_build_path}; read -n1"`

### Build Variables
There are a few variables to make your build command dynamic. The Variables are:

CProject specefic:
  * ${compiler} - The compiler as set in the project setings, e. g., g++

  * ${single_build_path} - Output file for single build.
  * ${run} - The run command as specified in the project setings.
  * ${single_run} - The run command for single builds. 
  * ${options} - The compiler options as specified in the project setings.
  * ${single_options} - The compiler options for single builds.
  * ${source_file} - The source file as specified in the project setings.
  * ${source_base_name} - The name only portion of the source_file as specified in the project setings.

Sublime Text standard:
  * ${file} - The full path to the current file, e. g., C:\Files\Chapter1.txt.
  * ${file_path} - The directory of the current file, e. g., C:\Files.
